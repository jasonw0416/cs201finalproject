# cs201finalproject

## Establishing Database

You must run database/final project.sql to create the table. Afterwards, you must run trojan_sched_resuls.sql, trojan_sched_courses.sql, trojan_sched_credentials.sql, and trojan_sched_professors.sql to insert the data into the table.

## Initializing the Environment of the Exported Eclipse Project

Import CSCI201_FINAL.zip like how we were taught in class CSCI 201. Afterwards, locate to src/main/java/JDBCHandler.java and edit SQL_USER, SQL_PASSWORD, and SQL_CONNECTION to match your own MySQL information. The name of schema and port number may need to be changed as well (the default name of schema is "mydb" and port number is 3306). 

## Running the Project

Run on the Tomcat server. 

## Other Files

There are multiple other files in the github repository that is already inside the CSCI_FINAL.zip. In addition, there are web scrabing codes in this repository as well.
